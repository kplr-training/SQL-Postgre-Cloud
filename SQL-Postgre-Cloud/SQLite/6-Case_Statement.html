<h1>CASE Statements</h1>
<h3>5.1 Categorizing Wind Speed</h3>
<p>You can use a <code>CASE</code> statement to turn a column value into another value based on conditions. For instance, we can turn different <code>wind_speed</code> ranges into <code>HIGH</code>, <code>MODERATE</code>, and <code>LOW</code> categories.</p>
<p>```sql
SELECT report_code, year, month, day, wind_speed,</p>
<p>CASE
   WHEN wind_speed &gt;= 40 THEN 'HIGH'
   WHEN wind_speed &gt;= 30 THEN 'MODERATE'
   WHEN wind_speed &gt;= 0 THEN 'LOW'
   ELSE 'N/A'
END as wind_severity</p>
<p>FROM station_data
ORDER by wind_speed DESC;
```</p>
<h3>5.2 More Efficient Way To Categorize Wind Speed</h3>
<p>We can actually omit <code>AND wind_speed &lt; 40</code> from the previous example because each <code>WHEN</code>/<code>THEN</code> is evaluated from top-to-bottom. The first one it finds to be true is the one it will go with, and stop evaluating subsequent conditions.</p>
<p>```sql
SELECT report_code, year, month, day, wind_speed,</p>
<p>CASE
   WHEN wind_speed &gt;= 40 THEN 'HIGH'
   WHEN wind_speed &gt;= 30 THEN 'MODERATE'
   ELSE 'LOW'
END as wind_severity</p>
<p>FROM station_data
```</p>
<h3>5.3 Using CASE with GROUP BY</h3>
<p>We can use <code>GROUP BY</code> in conjunction with a <code>CASE</code> statement to slice data in more ways, such as getting the record count by <code>wind_severity</code>.</p>
<p>```sql
SELECT </p>
<p>CASE
   WHEN wind_speed &gt;= 40 THEN 'HIGH'
   WHEN wind_speed &gt;= 30 THEN 'MODERATE'
   WHEN wind_speed &gt;= 0 THEN 'LOW'
   ELSE 'N/A'
END AS wind_severity,
COUNT(*)  AS record_count
FROM station_data
GROUP BY wind_severity;
```</p>
<p>Also, some wind_speed values are NULL, so without an <code>ELSE</code> any records that do not meet a condition will turn out to be NULL. </p>
<p>```sql 
SELECT </p>
<p>CASE
   WHEN wind_speed &gt;= 40 THEN 'HIGH'
   WHEN wind_speed &gt;= 30 THEN 'MODERATE'
   WHEN wind_speed &gt;= 0 THEN 'LOW'</p>
<p>END AS wind_severity,
COUNT(*)  AS record_count
FROM station_data
GROUP BY wind_severity;
```</p>
<h3>5.4 "Zero/Null" Case Trick</h3>
<p>There is really no way to create multiple aggregations with different conditions unless you know a trick with the <code>CASE</code> statement. If you want to find two total precipitation, with and without tornado precipitations, for each year and month, you have to do separate queries.</p>
<p><strong>Tornado Precipitation</strong>
<code>sql
SELECT year, month,
SUM(precipitation) as tornado_precipitation
FROM station_data
WHERE tornado = 1
AND year &gt;= 1990
GROUP BY year, month</code></p>
<p><strong>Non-Tornado Precipitation</strong>
<code>sql
SELECT year, month,
SUM(precipitation) as non_tornado_precipitation
FROM station_data
WHERE tornado =0
AND year &gt;= 1990
GROUP BY year, month</code></p>
<p>But you can use a single query using a <code>CASE</code> statement that sets a value to 0 if the condition is not met. That way it will not impact the sum.</p>
<p>```sql
SELECT year, month,
SUM(CASE WHEN tornado = 1 THEN precipitation ELSE 0 END) as tornado_precipitation,
SUM(CASE WHEN tornado = 0 THEN precipitation ELSE 0 END) as non_tornado_precipitation</p>
<p>FROM station_data
WHERE year &gt;= 1990</p>
<p>GROUP BY year, month
```</p>
<p>Many folks who are not aware of the zero/null case trick will resort to derived tables (not covered in this class but covered in <em>Advanced SQL for Data Analysis</em>), which adds an unnecessary amount of effort and mess.</p>
<p>```sql
SELECT t.year,
t.month,
t.tornado_precipitation,
non_t.non_tornado_precipitation</p>
<p>FROM (
    SELECT year, month,
    SUM(precipitation) as tornado_precipitation
    FROM station_data
    WHERE tornado =1
    AND year &gt;= 1990
    GROUP BY year, month
) t</p>
<p>INNER JOIN</p>
<p>(   SELECT year, month,
    SUM(precipitation) as non_tornado_precipitation
    FROM station_data
    WHERE tornado =0
    AND year &gt;= 1990
    GROUP BY year, month
) non_t
```</p>
<h3>5.5 Using Null in a CASE to conditionalize MIN/MAX</h3>
<p>Since <code>NULL</code> is ignored in SUM, MIN, MAX, and other aggregate functions, you can use it in a <code>CASE</code> statement to conditionally control whether or not a value should be included in that aggregation.</p>
<p>For instance, we can split up max precipitation when a tornado was present vs not present.</p>
<p><code>sql
SELECT year,
MAX(CASE WHEN tornado = 0 THEN precipitation ELSE NULL END) as max_non_tornado_precipitation,
MAX(CASE WHEN tornado = 1 THEN precipitation ELSE NULL END) as max_tornado_precipitation
FROM station_data
WHERE year &gt;= 1990
GROUP BY year</code></p>

<h3>Exercise 5.1</h3>
<p>SELECT  the report_code, year, quarter, and temperature, where a “quarter” is “Q1”, “Q2”, “Q3”, or “Q4” reflecting months 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, and 10-12 respectively.</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong></p>
<p>```sql
SELECT</p>
<p>report_code,
year,</p>
<p>CASE
    WHEN month BETWEEN 1 and 3 THEN 'Q1'
    WHEN month BETWEEN 4 and 6 THEN 'Q2'
    WHEN month BETWEEN 7 and 9 THEN 'Q3'
    WHEN month BETWEEN 10 and 12 THEN 'Q4'
END as quarter,</p>
<p>temperature</p>
<p>FROM STATION_DATA
```</p>
<h3>Exercise 5.2</h3>
<p>Get the average temperature by quarter and month, where a “quarter” is “Q1”, “Q2”, “Q3”, or “Q4” reflecting months 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, and 10-12 respectively.</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER</strong></p>
<p>```sql
SELECT
year,</p>
<p>CASE
    WHEN month BETWEEN 1 and 3 THEN 'Q1'
    WHEN month BETWEEN 4 and 6 THEN 'Q2'
    WHEN month BETWEEN 7 and 9 THEN 'Q3'
    WHEN month BETWEEN 10 and 12 THEN 'Q4'
END as quarter,</p>
<p>AVG(temperature) as avg_temp</p>
<p>FROM STATION_DATA
GROUP BY 1,2
