<h1>4.GROUP BY and ORDER BY</h1>
<h3>4.1: Getting a count of records</h3>
<p><code>sql
SELECT count(*) as record_count FROM station_data</code></p>
<h3>4.2 Getting a count of records with a condition</h3>
<p><code>sql
SELECT count(*) as record_count FROM station_data
WHERE tornado = 1</code></p>
<h3>4.3 Getting a count by year</h3>
<p><code>sql
SELECT year, count(*) as record_count
FROM station_data
WHERE tornado = 1
GROUP BY year</code></p>
<h3>4.4 Getting a count by year, month</h3>
<p><code>sql
SELECT year, month, count(*) as record_count
FROM station_data
WHERE tornado = 1
GROUP BY year, month</code></p>
<h3>4.5 Getting a count by year, month with ordinal index</h3>
<p><code>sql
SELECT year, month, count(*) as record_count
FROM station_data
WHERE tornado = 1
GROUP BY 1, 2</code></p>
<h3>4.6 Using ORDER BY</h3>
<p><code>sql
SELECT year, month, count(*) as record_count
FROM station_data
WHERE tornado = 1
GROUP BY year, month
ORDER BY year, month</code></p>
<h3>4.7 Using ORDER BY with DESC</h3>
<p><code>sql
SELECT year, month, count(*) as record_count
FROM station_data
WHERE tornado = 1
GROUP BY year, month
ORDER BY year DESC, month</code></p>
<h3>4.8 Counting non-null values</h3>
<p><code>sql
SELECT COUNT(snow_depth) as recorded_snow_depth_count
FROM station_data</code></p>
<h3>4.9 Average temperature by month since year 2000</h3>
<p><code>sql
SELECT month, AVG(temperature) as avg_temp
FROM station_data
WHERE year &gt;= 2000
GROUP BY month</code></p>
<h3>4.10 Average temperature (with rounding) by month since year 2000</h3>
<p><code>sql
SELECT month, round(AVG(temperature),2) as avg_temp
FROM station_data
WHERE year &gt;= 2000
GROUP BY month</code></p>
<h3>4.11 Sum of snow depth</h3>
<p><code>sql
SELECT year, SUM(snow_depth) as total_snow
FROM station_data
WHERE year &gt;= 2005
GROUP BY year</code></p>
<h3>4.12 Multiple aggregations</h3>
<p>```sql
SELECT year,
SUM(snow_depth) as total_snow,
SUM(precipitation) as total_precipitation,
MAX(precipitation) as max_precipitation</p>
<p>FROM station_data
WHERE year &gt;= 2005
GROUP BY year
```</p>
<h3>EXERCISES</h3>
<p>Flip to slides</p>
<h3>4.13 Using HAVING</h3>
<p>You cannot use WHERE on aggregations. This will result in an error.</p>
<p><code>sql
SELECT year,
SUM(precipitation) as total_precipitation
FROM station_data
WHERE total_precipitation &gt; 30
GROUP BY year</code></p>
<p>You can however, use HAVING.</p>
<p><code>sql
SELECT year,
SUM(precipitation) as total_precipitation
FROM station_data
GROUP BY year
HAVING total_precipitation &gt; 30</code></p>
<h3>4.14 Getting Distinct values</h3>
<p>You can get DISTINCT values for one or more columns</p>
<p><code>sql
SELECT DISTINCT station_number FROM station_data</code></p>
<p>You can also get distinct combinations of values for multiple columns</p>
<p><code>sql
SELECT DISTINCT station_number, year FROM station_data</code></p>
